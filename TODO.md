# To do list

- [ ] CMake dependency management should be improved, at least modularized
- [ ] Document global initialization for curl
- [ ] Create issue for incorrect API documentation:
  - describe_index: dimension misnamed, incorrect type documented; status doc seems incomplete
- [ ] Document architecture, namespace deps, etc
- [ ] Consider noexcept interaction with allocations
- [ ] Add policy to public API for possibility of throwing
